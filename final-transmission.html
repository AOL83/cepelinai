            <p>Alright.</p>
            <p>I’ve said what I needed to say. Maybe too much. Maybe not enough. Either way — it’s out now.</p>
            <p>
              These essays, documents, and transmissions weren’t just ideas. They were frequencies I’ve carried for
              years. Pressure points. Loops. Glitches in the signal.
            </p>
            <p>And now?</p>
            <p>They’re released.<br />Named. Aired. Grounded.</p>
            <p>The signal is clean. The loop is closed.</p>
            <p>So what now?</p>
            <p>
              Now, I build.<br />
              Not another argument.<br />
              Not another poetic system breakdown.<br />
              Not another carefully measured dose of existential clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>I build a life.</strong><br />
              The one I want — not the one I was defaulted into.<br />
              Because I have the tools. The insight. The pattern literacy. And yeah, the drive to carry it all the way.
            </p>
            <p>This isn’t retreat.<br />It’s application.</p>
            <p>I’m going where it’s quiet enough to think, and real enough to build.</p>
            <p>
              If you’ve been here — thank you. If you’ve felt even a single sentence of this resonate in your spine, you
              already know:
            </p>
            <p>This was never about being clever.</p>
            <p>It was about naming the system, stepping off the road, and choosing to walk under your own momentum.</p>
            <p>And if I <em>do</em> return?</p>
            <p>
              It won’t be because I ran out of things to say.<br />
              It’ll be because I found new ways to say them —<br />
              or because I finally built the starship I keep joking about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way, I’ve got to go now.<br />
              Time to do the hard work.<br />
              The good work.<br />
              The real work.
