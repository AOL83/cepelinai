          <article class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented Harness, a modular, safety-first robotics control platform with formal state
                machines (SAFE_IDLE, ARMED, ESTOP), command aging, watchdogs, and authority arbitration between operator
                and autonomous sources.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a networked real-time control system using WebSockets and structured JSON protocols, including
                heartbeat monitoring, connection lifecycle management, and replayable command streams for post-mortem
                analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented fail-safe defaults and kill-path logic inspired by industrial and robotics safety
                architectures, ensuring that loss of input, stale commands, or subsystem failure always degrade to safe
                states.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed a human-centered command language and input abstraction layer (CLI, joystick-style input,
                replay), reducing operator cognitive load and preventing dangerous low-level actuation commands.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a clean, modular architecture with strict separation between intent, authority, and actuation,
                enabling future hardware, autonomy, and ROS-style integration without rewriting core logic.
              </li>
              <li>
                Applied structured logging and telemetry thinking to make system behavior observable, diagnosable, and
                auditable under fault conditions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Replicator AI Terminal — Full-Stack Systems Debugging &amp; Product Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Debugged and stabilized a broken multi-agent execution graph UI (graph.html) by treating it as a real
                production incident rather than a toy problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a non-invasive runtime diagnostic layer that instrumented the full render pipeline:
                <ul>
                  <li>Run ID resolution</li>
                  <li>LocalStorage payload selection</li>
                  <li>JSON parsing &amp; schema validation</li>
                  <li>Task/agent/link contract verification</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Added on-demand debug snapshot tooling to allow live inspection of the system without reloads, enabling
                reproducible diagnosis of rendering and state failures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented visible, user-facing failure modes (error banners, placeholder cards, layout warnings)
                instead of silent UI collapse — improving observability for non-technical users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Identified and fixed a critical TDZ runtime crash caused by a function being referenced before
                initialization, restoring full graph rendering without refactoring the system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Demonstrated full-stack reasoning across:
                <ul>
                  <li>Data contracts</li>
                  <li>DOM state</li>
                  <li>Layout geometry</li>
                  <li>Render timing</li>
                  <li>UI behavior</li>
                  <li>Persistence</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed the long-term architecture for Replicator as a multi-agent orchestration platform, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Agent recommendation and compatibility analysis</li>
                  <li>Skill gap detection</li>
                  <li>Bottleneck identification</li>
                  <li>Visual execution tracking</li>
                  <li>Automated and manual agent assignment</li>
                  <li>Future AI API integration (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Defined future infrastructure needs:
                <ul>
                  <li>Execution state engines</li>
                  <li>Agent lifecycle models</li>
                  <li>Async task hooks</li>
                  <li>Permission sandboxing</li>
                  <li>Secure credential handling</li>
                  <li>Scalable persistence</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                This project demonstrates real debugging discipline, safe instrumentation practices, and product-level
                thinking, not just feature coding.

            <h3>Research-Grade Systems Thinking &amp; Technical Communication</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Produced TR3C-style system architectures connecting propulsion, electromagnetics, control, materials, and

              </li>
              <li>
                Designed test matrices and measurement plans specifying what data would be required to validate or
                falsify claims (e.g., field strengths, Q-factors, thrust-to-power ratios, latency bounds, failure
                thresholds).
              </li>
              <li>
                Demonstrated working knowledge of electric propulsion families (Hall, pulsed, MPD-class concepts),

          <h2>Final Transmission</h2>
          <div class="transmission-panel">
            <h3 class="transmission-title">FINAL TRANSMISSION: FROM NOISE TO SIGNAL</h3>
            <p>Alright.</p>
            <p>I’ve said what I needed to say. Maybe too much. Maybe not enough. Either way — it’s out now.</p>
            <p>
              These essays, documents, and transmissions weren’t just ideas. They were frequencies I’ve carried for
              years. Pressure points. Loops. Glitches in the signal.
            </p>
            <p>And now?</p>
            <p>They’re released.<br />Named. Aired. Grounded.</p>
            <p>The signal is clean. The loop is closed.</p>
            <p>So what now?</p>
            <p>
              Now, I build.<br />
              Not another argument.<br />
              Not another poetic system breakdown.<br />
              Not another carefully measured dose of existential clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>I build a life.</strong><br />
              The one I want — not the one I was defaulted into.<br />
              Because I have the tools. The insight. The pattern literacy. And yeah, the drive to carry it all the way.
            </p>
            <p>This isn’t retreat.<br />It’s application.</p>
            <p>I’m going where it’s quiet enough to think, and real enough to build.</p>
            <p>
              If you’ve been here — thank you. If you’ve felt even a single sentence of this resonate in your spine, you
              already know:
            </p>
            <p>This was never about being clever.</p>
            <p>It was about naming the system, stepping off the road, and choosing to walk under your own momentum.</p>
            <p>And if I <em>do</em> return?</p>
            <p>
              It won’t be because I ran out of things to say.<br />
              It’ll be because I found new ways to say them —<br />
              or because I finally built the starship I keep joking about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way, I’ve got to go now.<br />
              Time to do the hard work.<br />
              The good work.<br />
              The real work.
